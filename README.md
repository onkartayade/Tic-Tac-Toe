# Java Tic-Tac-Toe

A lightweight, console-based 3x3 Tic-Tac-Toe game written in Java. This project demonstrates basic Java logic, including loops, conditional statements, and exception handling for user input.



## Features
* **Input Validation:** Prevents players from choosing occupied slots or entering invalid characters.
* **Win Detection:** Automatically checks for horizontal, vertical, and diagonal wins.
* **Draw Detection:** Recognizes when the board is full, with no winner.
* **Console Interface:** Simple and clean ASCII-based UI.

## How to Play
The board is numbered 1 through 9. Each player enters a number to place their mark (X or O) in the corresponding slot.

| 1 | 2 | 3 |
|---|---|---|
| 4 | 5 | 6 |
| 7 | 8 | 9 |
